## Introduction

This is set up without point counts so that it should work with any NT range.
The 2c response always promises at least an invite, so it's safe for a max
NT opener to jump to 3N.

1N-2C >= invitational, no 5+M, no 6+m, not 4441, not 5440 [sim](https://hildjj.github.io/bridge-deal/?name=Puppet+15-17&stamp=1713800865835&code=eJzLyy8qyeBSUDA01TU011FISsxJzEtOTTEFCiVlpigY-gEZXCBWABdXcX4pWK2iooKNmbMOkHBR0NdXCClKzCtOSy0CySgk5lUqmJiYGOoASQNTEGlqAFJUlFpckJ-XomAcAVRmoQ3UbOoBIoKhFhk5c0GsAQBvYiNt)
