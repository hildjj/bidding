    2X! To play

    3X! Transfer, invite or better, ignore implied suits
    3N! To play, no slam interest

1N-2DHS-2N-3C! Artificial, forced
  P 3C to play
  3DHS (not implied suit) to play
  3DHS (implied suit) stayman, with stopper in implied suit
  3N to play, with 1.5+/2 suits stopped or 1/1 implied suit stopped

1N-3X! Transfer through implied suits.  Note that this is invite+.
  3X+1) Minimum.  Responder can bid on with GF values
  3N Maximum, limited support
  4Y Maximum with support

## After weak two

Weak two, followed by a double in the direct overcall seat only.

2DHS weak
  D Takeout
    P didn't have 3 in support, probably
      * Transfer Lebensohl on as if takeout doubler had bid 1N; Figure doubler for about 13 points until they say something else.

NOT on after 2X-P-P-X, since direct overcall seat didn't have enough points to act.

### Invite+
