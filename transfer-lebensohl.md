  3X+1) Minimum.  Responder can bid on with GF values
  3N Maximum, limited support
  4Y Maximum with support

## After weak two

Weak two, followed by a double in the direct overcall seat only.

2DHS weak
  X Takeout
    P didn't have 3 in support, probably
      X Transfer Lebensohl on as if takeout doubler had bid 1N; Figure doubler for about 13 points until they say something else.

NOT on after 2X-P-P-X, since direct overcall seat didn't have enough points to act.
