# 1D

11-15, 2+!d.  Not suitable for 1N (13-15).  No 5M unless 6!d.  Not suitable
for 2C (5c4M with good clubs or 6+c).  Announce: "Could be short".
No jumps by opener are forcing; responder is captain since opener is limited
to 15. [sim](https://hildjj.github.io/bridge-deal/?name=SMP+1D&stamp=1743348638300&code=eJw9jrEOgjAYhHef4pgpIUXbwbDp4IKa-ASl_UkJpGgpGt7eVo3rfd9dzk0-2A2QZZwXXDBUuWGopUZZ4uqp8PRIWOSaYdek9HInh-rAsMyLGsc1Yb79lFs1KqfJiL_HzxHLtCm-5QFhglVPgjjd0HcdpIlK_cPBkn_1MzG4KSQlsrY34Mc9GrWiJcw2fn4D0XEwug)
